	<h1>Games I've Played</h1>
	<section>
		<h2>Mostly Shooters and Stuff</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Mass Effect 3 Multiplayer</li>
			<li>Halo: Combat Evolved
				<div class="accolades">
					<span class="difficulty max">Legendary solo</span>
				</div>
				<p class="thoughts">I really liked Halo: CE. It was a strong game, and I've had a soft spot for the Halo story - I don't think it's particularly deep or told with finesse, but it's <em>fun</em>!</p>
			</li>
			<li>Halo 2
				<div class="accolades">
					<span class="difficulty hard">Heroic co-op</span>
				</div>
				<p class="thoughts">I've been telling myself I'm going to beat Halo 2 on legendary by myself since the day I beat Halo: CE on legendary. I feel the overwhelming urge to be able to say I've beaten the whole trilogy on the hardest difficulty! On the other hand, it's really goddamn hard.</p>
			</li>
			<li>Halo 3
				<div class="accolades">
					<span class="difficulty max">Legendary co-op</span>
					<span class="difficulty max">Legendary solo</span>
					<span class="achievement max">All Skulls found</span>
				</div>
			</li>
			<li>Halo 3: ODST
				<div class="accolades">
					<span class="difficulty hard">Heroic co-op</span>
				</div>
			</li>
			<li>Halo: Reach
				<div class="accolades">
					<span class="difficulty hard">Heroic co-op</span>
				</div>
			</li>
			<li>Gears of War
				<div class="accolades">
					<span class="difficulty max">Insane co-op</span>
				</div>
			</li>
			<li>Gears of War 2
				<div class="accolades">
					<span class="difficulty hard">Hardcore co-op</span>
				</div>
			</li>
			<li>Gears of War 3
				<div class="accolades">
					<span class="difficulty hard">Hardcore co-op</span>
				</div>
			</li>
			<li>Half-Life</li>
			<li>Half-Life: Blue Shift</li>
			<li>Half-Life: Opposing Force</li>
			<li>Half-Life 2 (and Episode 1) (and Episode 2)</li>
			<li>Portal</li>
			<li>Portal 2 (and co-op)</li>
			<li>Army of Two</li>
			<li>Army of Two: 40th Day</li>
			<li>Operation Flashpoint: Dragon Rising
				<div class="accolades">
					<span class="achievement bad">Gave up after like 30 minutes</span>
				</div>
				<p class="thoughts">This game was terrible.</p>
			</li>
			<li>Resistance: Fall of Man
				<div class="accolades">
					<span class="difficulty hard">Hard? co-op</span>
				</div>
			</li>
			<li>Resistance 3
				<div class="accolades">
					<span class="difficulty hard">Hard co-op</span>
				</div>
				<p class="thoughts">These games weren't very deep, but they had decent shooting and good weapons. Resistance 2 didn't have co-op, so I didn't play it - I just watched my friend do it.</p>
			</li>
			<li>Killzone 3
				<div class="accolades">
					<span class="difficulty hard">Veteran? co-op</span>
				</div>
				<p class="thoughts">This game offered alternate color modes for colorblindness, which is awesome. Shame the dialogue and plot was so literally laughable.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>Resident Evil 5
				<div class="accolades">
					<span class="difficulty hard">Veteran? co-op</span>
					<span class="achievement max">Broke one level</span>
				</div>
				<p class="thoughts">My pal and I played this over one break, and we couldn't take it seriously. Once we beat it, we spent our hard-earned points on getting infinite ammo for a few weapons - and decided we'd try to unlock infinite ammo for every weapon. We didn't end up doing that, but we did get so practiced at going through one level - which drops the most money for the time you spend in it by <em>far</em> - that we beat the max difficulty time trial by <em>half</em>. The magnum in that game is ridiculously overpowered.</p>
			</li>
			<li>F.3.A.R.
				<div class="accolades">
					<span class="difficulty hard">Fearless? co-op</span>
				</div>
				<p class="thoughts">As far as I can tell, these people have no idea what the phrase "survival horror" even means.</p>
			</li>
			<li>Team Fortress</li>
			<li>Team Fortress 2</li>

		<h2>Extremely Indie</h2>
		<p>(This section is kinda by nature going to be extremely incomplete; a lot of these games take like ten minutes to play, and often get forgotten. Talk to me and I'll recommend more, and just check out every game by <a href="http://aliendovecote.com/">porpentine</a>.)</p>

				<p class="thoughts">I love this game so much I'm not even going to write about it. I'd say too much.</p>
			</li>
			<li>Ico
				<p class="thoughts">Ico was very pretty, and had some of the same qualities that Shadow of the Colossus had, but it didn't tie together nearly so well.</p>

				<div class="accolades">
					<span class="difficulty normal">Easy</span>
					<span class="achievement hard">Test of Faith (Pacifist)</span>

				<p class="thoughts">I loved this game from an aesthetic point of view, but I kept waiting for the story to get interesting. I'm still waiting.</p>
			</li>
			<li>Zeno Clash
				<p class="thoughts">The aesthetic really makes this game stand out.</p>
			</li>
			<li>Iji
				<div class="accolades">
					<span class="difficulty normal">Normal</span>
					<span class="achievement normal">Somewhat Pacifist</span>
				</div>
				<p class="thoughts">Iji remains one of my favorite games of all time, for its excellent pseudo-morality system - one of the best I've seen.</p>
			</li>
			<li>Valkyrie Chronicles
				<div class="accolades">
					<span class="difficulty normal">Normal</span>
					<span class="achievement normal">No deaths</span>

					<span class="achievement normal">Both endings</span>
					<span class="achievement normal">Altruist (all vigils)</span>
					<span class="achievement normal">Mind Voyager (each trip to Who Knows Where)</span>
				</div>
				<p class="thoughts">Oh gosh this game. I loved it so much. Such a masterpiece of storytelling - two days after getting it I finished it, and two days later I finished my second playthrough. When I design games, this is what I try for - with maybe more female characters.</p>
