<h1>Games Diary?</h1>
<h2>January 15, 2015</h2>
<p>Starting a diary to try and record what I've been up to, and stuff, in a more freeform way.</p>
<p>Recently I've poked at Hatoful Boyfriend, I've been continuing to play New Super Mario Bros 2 from time to time, and I just finished the Forgotten Shores expansion for Monument Valley. Also I've been playing daily games of 3DS Smash Bros with my coworkers. Mostly though, I'm trying to beat Mass Effect.</p>
