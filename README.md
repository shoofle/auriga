# This is my server! It's not much, but it's mine.

It runs on flask. It's kinda messy! This is one project I'm working on strictly for results - I just want to post stuff as easily as possible, with as little hassle as possible (but avoiding having to use PHP). There might be some slightly-more-complicated stuff in here using blueprints or subapplications, so that I can extend things! It's not done, though.
