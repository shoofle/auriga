Verse 1:
          G               C
When the ship runs out of ocean
         G              F
And the vessel runs aground
E               G        C       G
Lands where we know the boat is found
              G         C
Now There's nothing unexpected
            G            F
About the water running out
   E              G      C        G        
"Land" is not a word we have to shout

Pre Chorus:
               D                    C
But there's something beside the shoreline
G                    F
Moving across the beachhead
D                      C
Coming up from the shipwreck
G                D
Making as if to say

Chorus:
         G        C        G           D
Women & Meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeen
         G        C        G           G
Women & Meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeen
         G        C        G           D
Women & Meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeen
         G        C        G           G
Women & Meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeen

Bridge: ( Just Follow the patterns )
Bringing with them messages of love
And everywhere they go love will grow
When you see the faces of the women
And the men you soon will know

Verse 2:
Women and men have crossed the ocean
They now begin to pour
out of the boat and up to the shore
Two by two they enter the jungle
And soon they number more
Three by three as well as four by four

Pre Chorus:
Soon the stream of people gets wider
Then it becomes a river
river becomes an ocean
carrying ships that bear

Chorus
Women and men
Women and men
Women and men
Women and men
