Let's Be Space Pirates, by Ruth Shuford


capo 1

 
Verse 1:
 
G
We should blast off into the galaxies
C
and sail a pirate ship upon cosmic seas.
G
We’d dance upon a carpet of stars with bare feet
C
in our shining home made of steel and concrete.
 
Chorus:
D                    C        G
Won’t you sail away with me?
D                   C            G
Space pirates on the cosmic sea.
Won’t you sail away with me?
Space pirates on the cosmic sea.
 
Verse 2:
 
We’d rob other spaceships gliding through the black
and raise Jolly Roger, not the Union Jack.
If we didn’t get hit by their lasers and fried
we’d be astronomical Bonnie and Clyde.
 
Chorus
 
Verse 3:
I’d yell, “Yar-har, ye mateys, nebula ho!”
And you’d steer us safe through the space tidal flow,
as we sailed past supernovae and black holes,
and dazzled everyone with some barrel rolls.

 
Chorus
 
Bridge:
D                C      D          C
You and me and a rocket ship,
yeah you and me and a rocket ship,
you and me and a rocket ship,
G
let's blast off today.
 
Chorus
