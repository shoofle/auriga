at large sizes, we have two columns, a main column and a sidebar.

for super-huge screens, the main column  and the sidebar are both fixed sizes.
as you shrink, the sidebar shrinks until the proportions are 2/3 main column and 1/3 sidebar
as you shrink, both scale, keeping those proportions. however, the things in the main column do not shrink - they just rearrange.
at tablet sizes, part of the sidebar goes to the top, and part goes to the bottom, and we turn into a one-column layout.

when the screen is very large, I want the sidebar on the right - containing information about me, to grow, leaving the column on the left at a fixed size.
decreasing the viewport's width: when we get to the point where the screen is 2/3 leftcolumn and 1/3 right sidebar
