^-- biomechanics of soft tissue

sqrt((1 meters)/(6452 meters per second squared))*(6452 meters per second squared)
^-- assuming 50 MPa over an area of 5" by 3", we can accelerate at 6452 m/s/s. assume we can punch over a distance of 1 m (more if you do a crouching uppercut)

then we get to 80.32 m/s

657.8 meters range! or half that for the height.
